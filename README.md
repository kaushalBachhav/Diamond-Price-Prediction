# Diamond Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the price of diamonds using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features of diamonds, including carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and other relevant attributes that influence the price.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes numerical features.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand feature importance and relationships between features and the target variable (diamond price).

- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes an XGBoost model for price prediction due to its efficiency and high performance in regression tasks.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess the model's accuracy and performance.

- **Visualization**: Provides feature importance charts and a comparison of predicted vs actual diamond prices for deeper insights.
